This is my othello game in Javascript/Jquery .
No AI though, its for 2 players playing on the same PC. 
Had/have plans to give this truly multiplayer capabilities...

One particular feature this game requires, that I managed to implememnt was to detect whose turns is it next, because its not guaranteed to switch and instead depends upon available moves.
